# P5.js Flowfield Animation/Simulation

![Flowfield animation demo](demo.gif)

A flowfield animation/simulation using perlin noise to assign individual direction to each pixel on the canvas.
The starting points are random and the direction of each pixel is shifted over time, to achive a more "hairy" look.

Made with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).
